In this talk, I show how to design globally stable guiding vector fields to enable motion coordination among robots; I also show how to construct composite guiding vector fields to avoid colliding with obstacles of arbitrary shapes. Both theoretical guarantees and experimental validations are discussed for practical scenarios. Given the growing interest in generative AI, I will also show how chatbot can be a potential new tool for robotic navigation.", "type": "Document"}}
